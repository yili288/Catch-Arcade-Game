# Catching-Arcade-Game

The objective is to catch falling boxes with a controllable basket. As the game progresses, boxes will fall faster and more frequently.

Control the basket using left and right arrow keys.
Start, pause and restart the game using the left most push button

Technology: C, GitHub, Sublime Text.

How it works:
Written in C code for the DE1-SoC Computer System with ARM Cortex-A9. This game makes use of PS/2 keyboard, interrupt request (IRQ) exception, VGA Monitor with double buffering and character buffering to work. Also works on the ARMV7 DE1-SoC simulator https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc.
